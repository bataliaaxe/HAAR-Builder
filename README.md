# HAAR-Builder
This repository is for developments in image processing utilizing Python, OpenCV, Haar cascades and LBP cascades.
Current interests include Haar training with OpenCV in the cloud, Python programming on the Raspberry Pi platform, 
and related engineering activities.

I'm willing to help individuals who are interested in setting up a cloud server with Python bindings to OpenCV to start image training. The plan is to collect a repository of open source Haar cascades and LBP cascades for use in commercial and non-commercial projects.
